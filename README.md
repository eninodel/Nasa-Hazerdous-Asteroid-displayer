# Nasa_Hazerdous_Asteroid_Displayer
This program accesses NASA's public API to obtain daily information about
potential dangerous asteroids and information about them such as name, 
velocity, and miles from Earth. This program then sends the information to 
an LCD screen attached to a Raspberry Pi.
